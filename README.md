# Dynamic-Malware-Analysis
 In this project, we create and identify possible models to be used in the detection of Android malware. The malware classiﬁcation problem is inherently more challenging than the malware detection problem.
 The method implemented in order to detect the presence of malware in an Android application. Dynamic analysis refers to monitoring the behavior of Android application software when it is executed. The monitoring scope of most dynamic analysis methods is mainly access to sensitive data and API calls, etc.
For the Dynamic Analysis we used a “Network Traffic Android Malware” dataset. This dataset consists of the network layer features that help in detecting the malware using the ML algorithms. These features are recorded during the runtime of the application.
This dataset has around 17 features. Some of them Are:
TCP packets,External IP’s,UDP packets,DNS Query,Volume bytes etc.
